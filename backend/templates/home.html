<!-- After we create the layout.html file in the templates folder. now here in the home template, we will get rid of the repetition code and replace it with the code block below which includes the repeated code here in the home template without needing to repeat the code -->
{% extends "layout.html" %}
<!-- then we include the unique content of the home template -->
{% block content %} {% endblock content %}

<!-- now lets do the same in the about template -->
